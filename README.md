# automatedInvoice
Automated Professional Excel Invoice with VBA

## Instructions
If you are reading this file it means that you are interested to use this invoice system. So let's make some changes to make this invoice more efficient.

At first copy this directory to C:\ drive So it should be C:\Challan

So you need to rename this directory as "Challan" and move this directory to C(Primary) drive. After that create "Report" directory inside the Challan folder and now you are ready to use this automated Excdel invoice.

P.S. There may be some intentional bug in this, so, you are requested to issue that bug if arise. Or you can modify the VBA code so that it can be rectified.
